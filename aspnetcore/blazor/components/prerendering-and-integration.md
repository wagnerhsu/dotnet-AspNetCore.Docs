# Prerender and integrate ASP.NET Core Razor components

::: zone pivot="webassembly"

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-5.0"

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution. When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.

## Configuration

To set up prerendering for a Blazor WebAssembly app:

1. Host the Blazor WebAssembly app in an ASP.NET Core app. A standalone Blazor WebAssembly app can be added to an ASP.NET Core solution, or you can use a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app created from the [Blazor WebAssembly project template](xref:blazor/project-structure).

1. Remove the default static `wwwroot/index.html` file from the Blazor WebAssembly client project.

1. Delete the following line in `Program.Main` in the client project:

   ```csharp
   builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
   ```

1. Add a `Pages/_Host.cshtml` file to the server project. You can obtain a `_Host.cshtml` file from an app created from the Blazor Server template with the `dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorServer` command in a command shell. After placing the `Pages/_Host.cshtml` file into the server app of the hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution, make the following changes to the file:

   * Set the namespace to the server app's `Pages` folder (for example, `@namespace BlazorHosted.Server.Pages`).
   * Set an [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directive for the client project (for example, `@using BlazorHosted.Client`).
   * Update the stylesheet links to point to the WebAssembly app's stylesheet. In the following example, the client app's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`:

     ```cshtml
     <link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     <link href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     ```

   * Update the `render-mode` of the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) to prerender the root `App` component:

     ```cshtml
     <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />
     ```

   * Update the Blazor script source to use the client-side Blazor WebAssembly script:

     ```cshtml
     <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
     ```

1. In `Startup.Configure` (`Startup.cs`) of the server project:

   * Call `UseDeveloperExceptionPage` on the app builder in the Development environment.
   * Call `UseBlazorFrameworkFiles` on the app builder.
   * Change the fallback from the `index.html` file (`endpoints.MapFallbackToFile("index.html");`) to the `_Host.cshtml` page: `endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");`.

   ```csharp
   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
   {
       if (env.IsDevelopment())
       {
           app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
           app.UseWebAssemblyDebugging();
       }
       else
       {
           app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
           app.UseHsts();
       }

       app.UseHttpsRedirection();
       app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles();
       app.UseStaticFiles();

       app.UseRouting();

       app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
       {
           endpoints.MapRazorPages();
           endpoints.MapControllers();
           endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
       });
   }
   ```

## Render components in a page or view with the Component Tag Helper

The Component Tag Helper supports two render modes for rendering a component from a Blazor WebAssembly app in a page or view:

* `WebAssembly`: Renders a marker for a Blazor WebAssembly app for use to include an interactive component when loaded in the browser. The component isn't prerendered. This option makes it easier to render different Blazor WebAssembly components on different pages.
* `WebAssemblyPrerendered`: Prerenders the component into static HTML and includes a marker for a Blazor WebAssembly app for later use to make the component interactive when loaded in the browser.

In the following Razor Pages example, the `Counter` component is rendered in a page. To make the component interactive, the Blazor WebAssembly script is included in the page's [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections). To avoid using the full namespace for the `Counter` component with the Component Tag Helper (`{APP ASSEMBLY}.Pages.Counter`), add an [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directive for the client app's `Pages` namespace. In the following example, the client app's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`:

```cshtml
...
@using BlazorHosted.Client.Pages

<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />

@section Scripts {
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
}
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the component:

* Is prerendered into the page.
* Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

The preceding example requires that the server app's layout (`_Layout.cshtml`) include a [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections) (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RazorPage.RenderSection%2A>) for the script inside the closing `</body>` tag:

```cshtml
    ...

    @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
</body>
```

The `_Layout.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages/Shared` folder in a Razor Pages app or `Views/Shared` folder in an MVC app.

If the app should also style components with the styles in the Blazor WebAssembly app, include the app's styles in the `_Layout.cshtml` file. In the following example, the client app's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`:

```cshtml
<head>
    ...

    <link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

## Render components in a page or view with a CSS selector

Add root components to the *Client* project in `Program.Main` (`Program.cs`). In the following example, the `Counter` component is declared as a root component with a CSS selector that selects the element with the `id` that matches `my-counter`. In the following example, the client app's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`:

```csharp
using BlazorHosted.Client.Pages;

...

builder.RootComponents.Add<Counter>("#my-counter");
```

In the following Razor Pages example, the `Counter` component is rendered in a page. To make the component interactive, the Blazor WebAssembly script is included in the page's [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections):

```cshtml
...

<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<div id="my-counter">Loading...</div>

@section Scripts {
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
}
```

The preceding example requires that the server app's layout (`_Layout.cshtml`) include a [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections) (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RazorPage.RenderSection%2A>) for the script inside the closing `</body>` tag:

```cshtml
    ...

    @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
</body>
```

The `_Layout.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages/Shared` folder in a Razor Pages app or `Views/Shared` folder in an MVC app.

If the app should also style components with the styles in the Blazor WebAssembly app, include the app's styles in the `_Layout.cshtml` file. In the following example, the client app's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`:

```cshtml
<head>
    ...

    <link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps in a Blazor Server app. When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.

After [configuring the app](#configuration), use the guidance in the following sections depending on the app's requirements:

* Routable components: For components that are directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when visitors should be able to make an HTTP request in their browser for a component with an [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive.
  * [Use routable components in a Razor Pages app](#use-routable-components-in-a-razor-pages-app)
  * [Use routable components in an MVC app](#use-routable-components-in-an-mvc-app)
* [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view): For components that aren't directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when the app embeds components into existing pages and views with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

## Configuration

An existing Razor Pages or MVC app can integrate Razor components into pages and views:

1. In the app's layout file (`_Layout.cshtml`):

   * Add the following `<base>` tag to the `<head>` element:

     ```html
     <base href="~/" />
     ```

     The `href` value (the *app base path*) in the preceding example assumes that the app resides at the root URL path (`/`). If the app is a sub-application, follow the guidance in the *App base path* section of the <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/index#app-base-path> article.

     The `_Layout.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages/Shared` folder in a Razor Pages app or `Views/Shared` folder in an MVC app.

   * Add a `<script>` tag for the `blazor.server.js` script immediately before the `Scripts` render section:

     ```html
         ...
         <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>

         @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
     </body>
     ```

     The framework adds the `blazor.server.js` script to the app. There's no need to manually add the script to the app.

1. Add an `_Imports.razor` file to the root folder of the project with the following content (change the last namespace, `MyAppNamespace`, to the namespace of the app):

   ```razor
   @using System.Net.Http
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
   @using Microsoft.JSInterop
   @using MyAppNamespace
   ```

1. In `Startup.ConfigureServices`, register the Blazor Server service:

   ```csharp
   services.AddServerSideBlazor();
   ```

1. In `Startup.Configure`, add the Blazor Hub endpoint to `app.UseEndpoints`:

   ```csharp
   endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
   ```

1. Integrate components into any page or view. For more information, see the [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view) section.

## Use routable components in a Razor Pages app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in Razor Pages apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App.razor` file to the project root with the following content:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <h1>Page not found</h1>
           <p>Sorry, but there's nothing here!</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

   [!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/includes/prefer-exact-matches.md)]

1. Add a `_Host.cshtml` file to the `Pages` folder with the following content:

   ```cshtml
   @page "/blazor"
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <app>
       <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </app>
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. Add a low-priority route for the `_Host.cshtml` page to endpoint configuration in `Startup.Configure`:

   ```csharp
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       ...

       endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   });
   ```

1. Add routable components to the app. For example:

   ```razor
   @page "/counter"

   <h1>Counter</h1>

   ...
   ```

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Use routable components in an MVC app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in MVC apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App.razor` file to the root of the project with the following content:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <h1>Page not found</h1>
           <p>Sorry, but there's nothing here!</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

   [!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/includes/prefer-exact-matches.md)]

1. Add a `_Host.cshtml` file to the `Views/Home` folder with the following content:

   ```cshtml
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <app>
       <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </app>
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. Add an action to the Home controller:

   ```csharp
   public IActionResult Blazor()
   {
      return View("_Host");
   }
   ```

1. Add a low-priority route for the controller action that returns the `_Host.cshtml` view to the endpoint configuration in `Startup.Configure`:

   ```csharp
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       ...

       endpoints.MapFallbackToController("Blazor", "Home");
   });
   ```

1. Create a `Pages` folder and add routable components to the app. For example:

   ```razor
   @page "/counter"

   <h1>Counter</h1>

   ...
   ```

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Render components from a page or view

*This section pertains to adding components to pages or views, where the components aren't directly routable from user requests.*

To render a component from a page or view, use the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

### Render stateful interactive components

Stateful interactive components can be added to a Razor page or view.

When the page or view renders:

* The component is prerendered with the page or view.
* The initial component state used for prerendering is lost.
* New component state is created when the SignalR connection is established.

The following Razor page renders a `Counter` component:

```cshtml
<h1>My Razor Page</h1>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

### Render noninteractive components

In the following Razor page, the `Counter` component is statically rendered with an initial value that's specified using a form. Since the component is statically rendered, the component isn't interactive:

```cshtml
<h1>My Razor Page</h1>

<form>
    <input type="number" asp-for="InitialValue" />
    <button type="submit">Set initial value</button>
</form>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="Static" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

## Component namespaces

When using a custom folder to hold the app's components, add the namespace representing the folder to either the page/view or to the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file. In the following example:

* Change `MyAppNamespace` to the app's namespace.
* If a folder named `Components` isn't used to hold the components, change `Components` to the folder where the components reside.

```cshtml
@using MyAppNamespace.Components
```

The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages` folder of a Razor Pages app or the `Views` folder of an MVC app.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index#namespaces>.
